# Big Data Analysis

1. As a part of this project I loaded truck fleet telemetric data for various models and driver behaviour.
2. After loading the data to Cloudera Hadoop, I created Hive tables using DDL for given data
3. I engineered some metrics like "truck mileage", "driver mileage" combining existing data to create a "risk factor"
4. I used a Apache PIG script to calculate and load data to "risk factor" table
5. Then I came  up with 2 business questions and tried to answer them
